        <p class="index_content_body">
          In the U.S., most people are reliant on insurance to get medically
          necessary benefits. This doesn't always work.
          <a
            href="https://www.kff.org/uninsured/issue-brief/key-facts-about-the-uninsured-population/#:~:text=As%20a%20result%2C%20after%20increasing,2019%20to%2010.2%25%20in%202021"
            >In the U.S., 10.2% of people are uninsured.
          </a>
          Even for those who are insured,
          <a
            href="https://www.drcatalyst.com/blog/medical-claim-denials-appeals-statistics-that-you-want-know#:~:text=30%25%20of%20claims%20are%20either,claim%20denials%20or%20payment%20delays"
          >
            30% of claims are “denied, lost, or ignored”.</a
          >
          Kids have no ability to defend themselves against denials, or to pick
          an insurance policy. That's why at Orthotful, we’ve decided to provide
          a solution to help ensure kids get the care they need--if their care
          team says they need an orthotic device, insurance shouldn't stand in
          the way. We partner with Orthotists to provide an alternative payment
          solution for medically necessary orthotic devices for children.
        </p>
        <h3 class="index_content_header">How Orthotful Works:</h3>
        <p class="index_content_body">
          We take patient privacy and the trust of our donors seriously, so we
          do not provide funds to patients directly at any time. Instead, we
          partner with the offices of qualified Orthotists (licensing
          requirements vary by state). They notify us when they have a patient
          that they think will be a good fit for our program, complete an
          application which confirms medical necessity and that they’ve
          attempted to follow all reasonable avenues to funding from other
          sources. We review the application, if approved, we send the
          Orthotist's office the funds needed to help the recipient. Because we
          are a nonprofit and our goal is to use our funds to do the most good
          possible, our payment rates are lower than most insurance companies.
          Therefore, orthotists are still incentivized to use the patient’s
          insurance as effectively as possible.
        </p>

        <h4 class="index_content_header">Our Criteria</h4>
        <p class="index_content_body">
          We provide coverage for items that are Medically Necessary according
          to the patient's doctor and care team, only if the family has demonstrable
          financial need and either the patient's insurance has denied the
          device as a non-covered service, or the patient is uninsured.
